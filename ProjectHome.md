A parallel recursive algorithm based on multi-level domain decomposition that can be used as a preconditioner to a Krylov subspace method to solve sparse linear systems of equations arising from the discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs).

The description of the algorithm can be found here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6266
